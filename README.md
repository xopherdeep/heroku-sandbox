# evilChat

This is the project around a Let's Code YouTube series: [Let's Code](http://bit.ly/1KK0lOp)

This part of the series implements a Socket.IO Chat Example application that is found [here](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/).

The Application is based on a front-end application project boilerplate called [simply-evil-js](https://github.com/evilsoft/simply-evil-js).

## System Requirements
The build system must be used on a POSIX compliant operating system (Linux, BSD, OSX, etc) running a recent version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) with a version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 2.0. Also you should probably have a CLI version of git installed. If you got all of that, then you are super sweet.

## Getting started
First I would watch through the [YouTube Series](http://bit.ly/1KK0lOp) just so can can see what the differences are between this repo and the [build system](https://github.com/evilsoft/simply-evil-js).

* Start off by cloning this repo down to a local directory.
* In the cloned directory, you need to install the dependencies with `$ npm install`.
* Once the dependencies are installed, you can start up the build system by running: `$ npm start`
* That should get you up and running. Be sure to check the build system's [README.md](https://github.com/evilsoft/simply-evil-js/blob/master/README.md) for other little goodies you can do with it.

### Some notes
* The branches used in the [series](http://bit.ly/1KK0lOp) are available for check out, by running: `$ git checkout [branch name here]`.
